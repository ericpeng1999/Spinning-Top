# Spinning-Top
Final Project for Phys 332 in Fall 2021. My teammates are Ravi Pitelka and Jake Otte from UNC.

We determined the equation of motion(EoM) of the spinning top using Lagrangian and Hamiltonian kinetics with Euler angles as the coordinate.
By interpreting the EoM, we were able to determine the necessary conditions for the three different types of motion of the spinning top.

The three initial conditions are given in the beginning of the code.
